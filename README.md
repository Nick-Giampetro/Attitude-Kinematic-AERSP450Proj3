# Attitude-Kinematic-AERSP450Proj3
Project by Nicholas Giampetro and Grace Savage

Originally completed for AERSP 450 on 12/07/2023, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on it.

MATLAB program that utilizes ODE45 to simulate angular motion and create DCMs representing the rotating frames orientation relative to some inertial frame at each time step.
